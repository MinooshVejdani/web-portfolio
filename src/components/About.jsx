        I'm Minoosh, a frontend developer passionate about crafting clean,
        minimal, and user-friendly interfaces. Coming from a background in
        design, I bring a strong focus on usability and aesthetics to every
        project I build. I love blending creativity with code to turn ideas into
        polished, real-world applications.
