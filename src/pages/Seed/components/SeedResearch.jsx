        Through research on Facebook and Reddit, I discovered that plant
        enthusiasts frequently swap and gift plants, cuttings, and related
        accessories. A notable example is the “West End Plant Swap and Gifting”
        group, which boasts 3,400 members. Given that West End is just a
        neighborhood in Vancouver, this highlights a significant demand for a
        dedicated platform for plant lovers.
